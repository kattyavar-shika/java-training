# Spring Boot and Microservices Course Outline

## 1. Introduction to SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - A class should have only one reason to change.
    - Example: A class handling business logic and persistence should be split into separate classes.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - Example: Use interfaces or abstract classes to extend functionality without changing existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    - Example: Derived classes should extend the base class without altering its expected behavior.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    - Example: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    - Example: Use dependency injection to reduce coupling between components.

## 2. Introduction to Microservices
- **Definition and Characteristics**
    - Microservices are an architectural style where an application is composed of loosely coupled services.
- **Benefits and Challenges**
    - Benefits: Scalability, flexibility, fault isolation.
    - Challenges: Complexity, data consistency, inter-service communication.
- **Use Cases**
    - Examples: E-commerce platforms, real-time data processing.
