# Understanding Java Streams

In Java, a **Stream** is a sequence of elements that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result. Streams are a key component of the Java Stream API, introduced in Java 8, and they provide a high-level abstraction for processing sequences of elements in a functional style.

## Key Characteristics of Streams

- **Declarative**: Streams allow you to specify what you want to achieve, rather than how to achieve it. This leads to more readable and maintainable code.

- **Functional Style**: Streams support a functional approach to processing sequences, including operations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

- **Lazy Evaluation**: Operations on streams are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked. This allows for optimization and efficiency improvements, such as short-circuiting or pipelining.

- **Non-Interfering**: The operations on a stream do not modify the underlying data structure. They produce a new stream or result, leaving the original data unchanged.

- **Parallel Processing**: Streams can be processed in parallel to take advantage of multi-core processors, potentially improving performance for large datasets.

## Types of Streams

- **Sequential Streams**: These process elements in a sequence, one after another.

- **Parallel Streams**: These can process elements concurrently using multiple threads, which can improve performance for large datasets.

## Basic Stream Operations

- **Intermediate Operations**: These operations transform a stream into another stream and are lazy. Examples include `filter`, `map`, and `sorted`.

- **Terminal Operations**: These produce a result or a side-effect and trigger the processing of the stream. Examples include `collect`, `forEach`, and `reduce`.
